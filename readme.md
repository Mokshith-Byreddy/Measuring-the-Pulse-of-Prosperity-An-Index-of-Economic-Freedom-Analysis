# Measuring the Pulse of Prosperity

## An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis (Tableau Dashboard Project)

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes how **economic freedom influences national prosperity** using the *Index of Economic Freedom* dataset.
Instead of theoretical discussion, the project uses **data visualization** to explore relationships between institutional quality and economic performance indicators such as:

* GDP per capita
* Unemployment rate
* Inflation
* Investment indicators

The analysis is implemented as an **interactive Tableau Dashboard and Story** that allows users to compare countries and identify global economic patterns.

## Problem Statement

Global economic datasets contain multiple indicators across more than 100 countries.
When viewed as raw tables, users cannot easily:

* Compare countries
* Detect patterns
* Understand economic relationships

As a result, discussions about economic policy often rely on opinion rather than data.

This project converts complex economic data into **visual analytical insights**.

---

## Objectives

* Analyze economic freedom indicators across countries
* Compare economic freedom with GDP per capita
* Study relationship with unemployment
* Identify top and bottom performing economies
* Visualize global regional differences
* Provide an interactive dashboard for analysis

---

## Dataset

**Source:** Index of Economic Freedom (Heritage Foundation)

### Key Variables

**Institutional Indicators**

* Property Rights
* Judicial Effectiveness
* Government Integrity
* Tax Burden
* Trade Freedom
* Investment Freedom
* Financial Freedom

**Economic Performance Indicators**

* GDP per Capita
* Inflation Rate
* Unemployment Rate
* Public Debt
